## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image (not completed)
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it (not completed)

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

The key elements missing from the solution is the "photo gallery" and the "cart card". Both features will be added as I do more research in the most efficient way to implement them.
